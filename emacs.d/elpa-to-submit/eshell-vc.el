;;; Commentary:

;; When this is required, the Eshell prompt should show the current
;; branch name. It will also will alter the prompt if there are
;; changes that haven't been checked in.

;; Currently this actually builds on magit functionality rather than
;; VC as it's not clear how to get this kind of info on a directory
;; rather than a file with VC.

;;; Code:

(defvar eshell-vc-dirty
  " âš  " "String to use for the prompt when there are uncomitted checkins.")

(defun eshell-vc-prompt ()
  "Return a prompt with VC branch and dirty state."
  (let ((branch (eshell/branch)))
    (propertize (concat (and branch (concat branch " "))
                        (eshell/pwd)
                        (cond ((= (user-uid) 0) " # ")
                              ((and branch (eshell/vc-dirty)) eshell-vc-dirty)
                              (t " $ ")))
                'face 'eshell-prompt)))

(defun eshell-vc-skip-prompt ()
  "Skip the prompt using text properties instead of a regex."
  (goto-char (next-property-change (point) nil (point-max))))

;; TODO: make this work with VC if possible rather than magit
(require 'magit)
(defalias 'eshell/branch 'magit-get-current-branch)
(defun eshell/vc-dirty () (not (magit-everything-clean-p)))
