# Emacs Configuration

## ELPA

To get a list of the available packages, you can use `M-x package-list-packages;` ELPA will download the most recent list in a buffer. Now, to install packages, move your cursor to them and press i. This will mark the packages for installation. When you're done with marking, press x, and ELPA will install the packages for you (under ~/.emacs.d/elpa/).
