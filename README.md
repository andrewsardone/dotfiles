Andrew Sardone's Dot Files
==========================

Inspired by others to put my dot files under git's control.

Reorganized files to be cleaner and more modular, taking influence from [Zach Holman](http://github.com/holman/dotfiles).

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/andrewsardone/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    pushd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install

## TODO

- Don't ask for `gitconfig` and GitHub credentials unless the `gitconfig` file is getting symlinked.
