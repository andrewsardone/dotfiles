Andrew Sardone's Dot Files
==========================

Inspired by others to put my dot files under git's control.

*08/03/2009* - Reorganized files to be cleaner and more modular, taking influence from [Ryan Bates](http://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles/tree/master).

### Installation

    cd ~/some/place/to/store/this/project
    git clone git://github.com/andrewsardone/dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    rake install

### TODO

- Write better README
