These are my dotfiles. There are many like it, but this one is mine. It is my life.

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/andrewsardone/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    make

## Bullet Points

- `vim` & `zsh`/`bash` as much as possible
- [GNU `stow`](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for putting things in the proper spots
- [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), [homebrew-cask](https://caskroom.github.io/), and
  [homebrew-bundle](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-bundle) for managing my macOS
  dependencies
